# Commit-Fluff

Welcome to Commit-Fluff, a fun and interactive way to craft your git commit messages!

## Why Commit-Fluff?

Once upon a time, in a codebase not so far away, a group of developers were having a bit of a giggle. The reason? My commit messages. Apparently, they weren't quite up to snuff. So, instead of sulking, I decided to turn this into an opportunity to create something fun and useful. And thus, Commit-Fluff was born!

## What does Commit-Fluff do?

Commit-Fluff is a simple bash script that guides you through the process of creating a commit message. It asks you a series of questions about the type of changes you're committing, whether it's a breaking change, and what your commit message is. It then constructs a commit message according to the Conventional Commits specification.

## How to use Commit-Fluff?

Just run the script before you're ready to commit your changes, answer the questions, and voila! You'll have a perfectly formatted commit message ready to go.

So, say goodbye to those boring old commit messages and say hello to Commit-Fluff! Let's make commit messages fun again!
